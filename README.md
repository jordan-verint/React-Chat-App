## Simple React App using Socket.io

This project uses socket.io to create a simple connection between users joining a chat application the session is not stored in a database simply stored in a user state within the application.

Very secrure and simple way of sending data across multiple clients using a simple node server using socket.io to distribute the calls and data back to the apps

### Getting started
